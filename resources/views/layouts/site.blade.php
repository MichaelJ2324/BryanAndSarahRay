                    <p>Sarah is the most caring and nurturing person I know. She loves to dance and to make everyone around her smile.
                    Sarah is very creative; she is a talented seamstress and is also an amazing cook. Sarah made my Halloween costume one year. I was a giant puppy, complete with paws and floppy ears. She made it all! I am also amazed by her cooking, she is vegan, I am not, and she still cooks for me.</p>
                    <p>The time spent with our nephews, children of friends, or any kids she encounters
                    has shown how wonderful and nurturing she is with kids of all ages. I am very excited to see her mother a baby of our own. I know that she has so much love and kindness to offer.</p>

                    <p>Bryan is the sweetest, kindest and most patient person I have ever met. He continues to amaze me every day with his generosity and willingness to help others. He finds a way to fix just about anything put in front of him and loves to work on and tinker with his car.</p>
                    <p>He is the “fun uncle” and all kids love to play with him, he plays just like a kid and normally has one of them fall asleep on him from all the fun! I know he is going to be an amazing father, just seeing Bryan playing with our nephews and godsons proves it.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to a mutual friend we met in the fall of 2005. Sarah had recently graduated from college and started working at a clothing store as a manager. Bryan had been working as a technician at the local car dealership for
                    a few years. We dated for just over a year when Bryan proposed in front of family and friends at the New
                    Years Eve party we hosted. Sarah was caught completely by surprise! Our wedding took place in a beautiful park on a gorgeous Saturday in May. Over the next eight years of marriage our love for one another has continued to flourish and grow.
                    We support, love, and cherish each other and can’t wait to share that with our baby.</p>

                        <p>For fun we enjoy taking trips, whether it be a day trip to IKEA or a water park or on a vacation in the Caribbean. We love doing
                            house projects, yet we are great at starting them and never completing them 100%. We
                            enjoy riding our bikes and walking around our neighborhood and just enjoying time together.</p>
                        <p>Sarah has blossomed into a great gardener. She has a very nice vegetable garden in the backyard that features eggplant, bell peppers, tomatoes and a number of other veggies. She has designed the front flower gardens to burst with vibrant colors of irises, tulips, and daffodils starting in the spring and lasting until the early fall.</p>
                        <p>Bryan’s job keeps his hands clean so he likes to work on cars in his free time. He enjoys taking something from broken
                            and making it like new on a Saturday afternoon. He doesn’t mind getting dirt under his fingernails or in his hair. One day he hopes to have his dream garage but for now the driveway works just fine. Family and friends know that his help is only a call or text away.</p>
